Musical Style
Garage, Indie, Punk
The key part of their sound, and one that translates across their whole discography,
is lead singer and frontman Alex Turner's intricate and often rapidly delivered
lyrics,
sung in a distinctive strong Sheffield accent that their music became famed for in their early years.
A large part of their iconic British sound is credited to the punk poet John
 Cooper Clarke from whom the Arctic Monkeys even borrowed lyrics and the title in
 "I Wanna Be Yours". Turner adapted Clarke's method of delivery mostly in their
 first album, Whatever People Say I Am That's What I'm Not.
